                </ul>
            </div>
              <div class="merge-sort">
        <h2>Applying Merge Sort in Real-Time Disaster Response Systems</h2>
        <p>In a Real-Time Disaster Response System, Merge Sort can be applied to efficiently sort and prioritize large volumes of real-time data (e.g., feedback, incident reports, or resource requests). Here's how:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Sorting:</strong> Incoming disaster-related data (e.g., citizen feedback, damage reports) can be sorted by priority (severity, time, or location). Merge Sort divides the data into smaller chunks, sorts them, and merges them in an organized order.</li>
            <li><strong>Efficient Resource Allocation:</strong> By sorting the data (e.g., urgent medical requests or flood reports), authorities can prioritize resources and respond to the most critical areas first.</li>
            <li><strong>Handling Large Datasets:</strong> Merge Sort’s O(n log n) complexity ensures it can efficiently process large volumes of data as new reports come in, maintaining real-time performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Categorization:</strong> Merge Sort helps in grouping similar reports (e.g., medical emergencies or infrastructure damage) by urgency, enabling quicker response.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In essence, Merge Sort ensures that disaster response teams can process and prioritize large datasets efficiently, enabling quick and effective decision-making.</p>
