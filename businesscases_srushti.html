    <div class="section-heading">Citizen Feedback Portal to Monitor and Improve Access to Safe, Inclusive, and Accessible Public Spaces</div>

    <h2>Relevant SDG Goal: Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG 11)</h2>
    <p><strong>Target:</strong> 11.7 - By 2030, provide universal access to safe, inclusive, and accessible, green, and public spaces, in particular for women, children, older persons, and persons with disabilities.</p>
    <p><strong>Indicator:</strong> 11.7.1 - Average share of the built-up area of cities that is open space for public use for all, by sex, age, and persons with disabilities.</p>

    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>Develop a Citizen Feedback Portal to monitor and improve accessibility, safety, and inclusivity in public spaces. This system will utilize road network design, algorithms for optimization, and real-time feedback to enhance urban planning and ensure all citizens, especially vulnerable groups, have equitable access to safe, inclusive, and accessible public spaces.</p>

    <h3>Algorithms for Safety and Inclusivity</h3>

    <div class="section-heading">1. Dijkstra's Algorithm</div>
    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Optimize the shortest paths between public spaces to ensure easy access, especially for vulnerable populations such as elderly, disabled, and women.</p>
    <p><strong>Input:</strong> The distance matrix representing the city’s road network.</p>
    <p><strong>Output:</strong> Shortest paths from residential zones to public service areas, hospitals, and commercial zones.</p>

    <div class="section-heading">2. Kruskal’s Algorithm</div>
    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Build a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) that connects all important public spaces with minimal cost and ensures no isolated areas.</p>

    <div class="section-heading">3. Prim’s Algorithm</div>
    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Ensure optimal connectivity between important nodes in the city, with a focus on making public spaces accessible to all residents.</p>

    <div class="section-heading">4. Citizen Feedback Portal</div>
    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Collect real-time feedback from citizens about the safety and accessibility of public spaces, allowing for continuous improvement in urban planning.</p>

    <h3>Safety and Inclusivity Features for Public Spaces</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pedestrian and Disability-Friendly Infrastructure:</strong> Develop wide sidewalks, pedestrian crossings, and ramps at intersections for wheelchair users and people with limited mobility. Ensure safe crossing signals for vulnerable groups like children and the elderly.</li>
        <li><strong>Public Space Accessibility:</strong> Green spaces, playgrounds, and parks should be designed to cater to all, including accessible pathways, wheelchair-friendly park benches, and inclusive public toilets.</li>
        <li><strong>Lighting and Surveillance:</strong> Install well-lit pathways and public spaces. Ensure the presence of security cameras and community policing to enhance safety.</li>
        <li><strong>Regular Audits and Updates:</strong> Regular audits based on feedback from the portal can identify areas in need of improvement, ensuring the continuous development of inclusive spaces.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Outcome and Impact</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Improved Public Space Accessibility:</strong> By using Dijkstra's algorithm and Kruskal’s algorithm, the city will ensure that all public spaces, including hospitals, parks, and residential areas, are connected with the shortest and safest paths, improving overall accessibility.</li>
        <li><strong>Real-Time Citizen Feedback:</strong> The Citizen Feedback Portal enables ongoing engagement from the community, ensuring that safety and accessibility issues are addressed in real time.</li>
        <li><strong>Inclusive Public Spaces:</strong> The combination of optimized road networks and feedback-driven design improvements ensures that public spaces are accessible to all demographics, including women, children, older persons, and persons with disabilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Safety Measures:</strong> The focus on lighting, pedestrian infrastructure, and community feedback ensures that public spaces remain safe for all users.</li>
    </ul>
