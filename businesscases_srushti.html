<section id="algorithms">
    <h2>Algorithms for Safety and Inclusivity</h2>
    <h3>Dijkstra's Algorithm</h3>
    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Optimize the shortest paths between public spaces to ensure easy access, especially for vulnerable populations such as elderly, disabled, and women. This helps prioritize routes that are safe, efficient, and inclusive.</p>
    <p><strong>Input:</strong> The distance matrix representing the city’s road network.</p>
    <p><strong>Output:</strong> Shortest paths from residential zones to public service areas, hospitals, and commercial zones.</p>
    <p><strong>Application:</strong> Dijkstra’s algorithm helps identify the most efficient routes, ensuring that hospitals (H1-H4) are easily accessible from residential areas (R1-R3) and public service zones (T1) are within reach of all citizens. Paths are prioritized based on accessibility, traffic safety, and ease of travel.</p>

    <h3>Kruskal’s Algorithm</h3>
    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Build a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) that connects all important public spaces with minimal cost and ensures no isolated areas.</p>
    <p><strong>Input:</strong> The city’s distance matrix (edges).</p>
    <p><strong>Output:</strong> MST connecting all public spaces to improve road network connectivity and accessibility.</p>
    <p><strong>Application:</strong> Kruskal’s algorithm ensures equitable access across all areas of the city by creating the least cost network of roads connecting hospitals, residential zones, commercial areas, and industrial hubs.</p>

    <h3>Prim’s Algorithm</h3>
    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Ensure optimal connectivity between important nodes in the city, focusing on making public spaces accessible to all residents.</p>
    <p><strong>Application:</strong> Prim's algorithm helps build an accessible road network to connect zones like hospitals and residential areas, reducing travel time for emergency services and other essential public services.</p>
</section>

<section id="citizen-feedback-portal">
    <h2>Citizen Feedback Portal</h2>
    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Collect real-time feedback from citizens about the safety and accessibility of public spaces, allowing for continuous improvement in urban planning.</p>
    <p><strong>Input:</strong> Data from citizens reporting issues related to public space safety, barriers for people with disabilities, and general accessibility.</p>
    <p><strong>Output:</strong> Improvements to infrastructure and public space designs based on real-time citizen input.</p>
    <p><strong>Application:</strong> The portal allows citizens to report issues such as lack of ramps, unsafe crosswalks, or inadequate lighting in public spaces. This data can be analyzed to update the city’s road network and public space designs, ensuring that all public spaces remain inclusive, accessible, and safe.</p>
</section>

<section id="safety-inclusivity-features">
    <h2>Safety and Inclusivity Features for Public Spaces</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pedestrian and Disability-Friendly Infrastructure:</strong> Develop wide sidewalks, pedestrian crossings, and ramps at intersections for wheelchair users and people with limited mobility. Ensure safe crossing signals for vulnerable groups like children and the elderly.</li>
        <li><strong>Public Space Accessibility:</strong> Green spaces, playgrounds, and parks should be designed to cater to all, including accessible pathways, wheelchair-friendly park benches, and inclusive public toilets.</li>
        <li><strong>Lighting and Surveillance:</strong> Install well-lit pathways and public spaces. Ensure the presence of security cameras and community policing to enhance safety.</li>
        <li><strong>Regular Audits and Updates:</strong> Regular audits based on feedback from the portal can identify areas in need of improvement, ensuring the continuous development of inclusive spaces.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="outcome-impact">
    <h2>Outcome and Impact</h2>
    <p><strong>Improved Public Space Accessibility:</strong> By using Dijkstra's and Kruskal’s algorithms, the city will ensure that all public spaces, including hospitals, parks, and residential areas, are connected with the shortest and safest paths, improving overall accessibility.</p>
    <p><strong>Real-Time Citizen Feedback:</strong> The Citizen Feedback Portal enables ongoing engagement from the community, ensuring that safety and accessibility issues are addressed in real time.</p>
    <p><strong>Inclusive Public Spaces:</strong> The combination of optimized road networks and feedback-driven design improvements ensures that public spaces are accessible to all demographics, including women, children, older persons, and persons with disabilities.</p>
    <p><strong>Safety Measures:</strong> The focus on lighting, pedestrian infrastructure, and community feedback ensures that public spaces remain safe for all users.</p>

 <h2>The Kurakals Algorithm in Citizen Feedback Portal</h2>
        <div class="algorithm">
            <p>The <strong>Kurakals Algorithm</strong> can be applied in a Citizen Feedback Portal in the following ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sentiment Analysis:</strong> It analyzes the tone of feedback (positive, neutral, or negative) to gauge public sentiment on services.</li>
                <li><strong>Categorization:</strong> The algorithm classifies feedback into relevant categories (e.g., healthcare, transportation) using keywords and patterns.</li>
                <li><strong>Trend Detection:</strong> It identifies emerging issues by tracking frequent concerns across feedback submissions.</li>
                <li><strong>Prioritization:</strong> Based on volume and severity, the algorithm prioritizes urgent issues for immediate attention.</li>
                <li><strong>Actionable Insights:</strong> Aggregated data provides actionable insights, helping governments make informed decisions, allocate resources, and improve services efficiently.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This helps streamline feedback processing, ensuring timely responses and effective governance.</p>
