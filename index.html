        <h2>What is this Course About?</h2>
        <p>This course introduces students to the world of algorithms and data structures, fundamental components of computer science. By studying the design, analysis, and application of algorithms, we gain skills in solving complex problems and optimizing solutions for real-world challenges.</p>

        <p>The course begins with basic concepts such as time and space complexities, recursion, and backtracking. It explores various data structures like binary trees, AVL trees, segment trees, red-black trees, and graphs. We delve into sorting algorithms, such as quicksort, mergesort, and heap sort, as well as graph algorithms, including Dijkstra’s shortest path and Prim’s algorithm for minimum spanning trees.</p>

        <p>As we progress, we explore advanced topics like NP-completeness, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and case studies, including the Travelling Salesperson Problem and the Knapsack Problem. The goal is to understand how these algorithms work, how to analyze their efficiency, and how to apply them to solve real-world problems.</p>
