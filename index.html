        <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
        <p>Hello! I’m Aarzoo, a passionate developer sharing my journey, projects, and learning reflections.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Course: Design and Analysis of Algorithms</h2>
            <p>Our course, Design and Analysis of Algorithms, introduces us to the fundamentals of algorithms and data structures, focusing on their design, analysis, and application. We cover core concepts like time and space complexities, recursion, backtracking, and advanced structures such as AVL Trees, Segment Trees, and Red-Black Trees.</p>

            <h3>What Have We Studied So Far?</h3>
            <p>We’ve covered a variety of data structures and algorithms including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Linear Data Structures: Arrays, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Binary Search Trees (BST), AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees, Tries, Graph Structures.</li>
                <li>Sorting Algorithms: Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and more.</li>
                <li>Graph Algorithms: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra’s, and Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms.</li>
                <li>Optimization Algorithms: Union-Find, Traveling Salesperson Problem, and Knapsack Problem.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How Does This Connect with Real-Time Applications?</h3>
            <p>The techniques we learn are widely used in real-world applications, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Smart City Design:</strong> Optimizing road networks and transport systems using algorithms like Dijkstra’s and Prim’s.</li>
                <li><strong>Sorting and Searching:</strong> Critical for organizing large datasets efficiently in search engines and databases.</li>
                <li><strong>Tree Data Structures:</strong> Used in file systems and compilers.</li>
                <li><strong>Hashing:</strong> Applied in cybersecurity and databases.</li>
                <li><strong>Competitive Programming:</strong> Problem-solving techniques for coding competitions and software development.</li>
                <li><strong>Real-Time Decision Making:</strong> Data compression and optimization methods for logistics and delivery planning.</li>
            </ul>
