            <h2>What is the Course About?</h2>
            <p>
                Our course, <span class="highlight">Design and Analysis of Algorithms</span>, introduces us to the fundamentals of algorithms and data structures, focusing on their design, analysis, and application.
                We start with core concepts like time and space complexities, recursion, and backtracking. Next, we delve into tools like hashing and Union-Find, along with advanced data structures such as AVL Trees, Segment Trees, and Red-Black Trees. Sorting and searching algorithms, including Quick Sort, KMP, and Rabin-Karp, help us understand efficient data processing techniques.
                Graph algorithms like Dijkstra’s shortest path and Prim’s spanning tree, and case studies such as the Travelling Salesperson Problem, show us how algorithms solve complex, real-world problems. The course also introduces concepts like NP-completeness and the limitations of algorithmic power.
                By the end, we gain a strong foundation in computational thinking and the ability to develop efficient solutions to challenging problems.
